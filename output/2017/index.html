      <article class="text">
          <p>Providing feedback is one of the most important parts of any software. Unfortunately, more often than not we tend to downplay or ignore the very simple yet crucial task of letting the user know what is going on. In this article I’ll use a short cautionary tale of how the lack of proper user feedback (and some laziness, I admit) almost cost me an entire HDD with years of personal data.</p>

          <p>Being clever is a good thing for a developer. Ingenuity allows us to write software that solves complex real-world problems. However, “clever” <em>code</em> is not always a good thing. In many cases — I dare say in <em>most</em> cases — it is a very bad thing. I consciously try to avoid writing code that might be seen as “clever”. The smart thing to do is trying hard not to be smart (yes, very <a href="http://literarydevices.net/war-is-peace/">1984</a>).</p>

<p>Developers tend to see themselves (quite indulgently) as smart people. Not many people understand what we do, and society sees a developer as a kind of modern wizard, writing unreadable magic spells in a small metal box. In reality, though, we are not half as smart as we think: for instance, if you are a developer, you are certainly familiar with the frustration of trying to understand some cryptic piece of code that seemed perfectly reasonable and straightforward when you wrote it a couple of months earlier.</p>

      <article class="text">
          <p>We got a 6-year-old Rails app with ~370k LOC and a ~6k-test suite which took 24 minutes to complete. Not good! We took a few days off of the main project to see if we could make things better.</p>

<p>More often than not, test suites are the nasty underbelly of a Rails app. Size and age just aggravate the problem. Tests are seldom a high priority in any project, and speed might not be an issue at all in smaller apps where the whole test suite might take just a few seconds to complete. As the project grows and the CI takes increasingly longer to complete, spec speed suddenly becomes more of an issue.</p>

<p>“Small” and “new” are not exactly the case for a certain Rails project we’re working on here at Guava. We’re talking about a 6-year-old e-commerce portal with ~370k LOC, a couple million customers and a ~6k-test, 300-spec suite which took, on average, a whopping 24 minutes to complete in our CI. <em>Not good!</em> So we took a couple of days off the main project to see if we could make things better — or less worse.</p>

      <article class="text">
          <p>What happens when your project’s RDBMS is just not enough to deal with unexpectedly huge amounts of data?</p>

<p>You could try to de-normalize some tables here and there to avoid unnecessary JOINs, create a few indexes, implement some kind of pagination or even pre-process the data into a more palatable format. However, if you did all that and it still was not enough, the “natural impulse” is to give up on the RDBMS altogether and just use Elasticsearch. Sounds like a no-brainer, right?</p>
